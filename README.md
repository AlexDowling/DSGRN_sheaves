## DSGRN Sheaves 

DSGRN is a computational tool to produce databases of 
dynamic signatures for switching models of regulatory 
networks. This project imposes an additional data
structure called a sheaf, which is used to track the
summaries of dynamics as models' parameters vary. 

By leveraging techniques from homological algebra, we can
interrogate this data structure for useful information
about bifurcations. This is leveraged in a search
algorithm, which uses graph matching and sheaf cohomology
to find regions of the parameter graph which exhibit the
characteristics of a particular bifurcation.
